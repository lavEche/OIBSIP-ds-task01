**Introduction:**

The Iris Flower Classification project is a machine learning endeavor that aims to classify iris flowers into their respective species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. This classification is based on measurements of key attributes, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Features:**

- Classification of iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.
- Utilizes machine learning models for accurate predictions.
- Potential for real-world applications in botanical research and horticulture.


### Model Performance:

The project employs various machine learning models, and their performance is evaluated using several metrics:

1. Training Accuracy
2. Testing Accuracy
3. Precision
4. Recall
5. F1-Score

> The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model, in particular, exhibits impressive testing accuracy at 97.3%, making it suitable for accurate species classification.
